# How to create a Blog using Nuxt

Purpose of this document is to provide hands on instructions to create a Blog using [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) and deploy if on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## Installation

First we create *Blog* project by installing Nuxt.

```bash
# using npm package manager
npm init nuxt-app <blog-project-name>

# using npx
npx create-nuxt-app <blog-project-name>

# using yarn
yarn create nuxt-app <blog-project-name>
```

### Exmaple

In this document we well create `My-Blog` using npm.

```bash
npm init nuxt-app my-blog
```

Once the `nuxt-app` project template is downloaded to your local machi`ne a set of questions will guide you through granurally configuring the `my-blog` project.

```bash
create-nuxt-app v3.7.1

üéâ  Successfully created project my-blog

  To get started:

	cd my-blog
	npm run dev

  To build & start for production:

	cd my-blog
	npm run build
	npm run start
```

Congratulations, you created your *Blog* project. Now it's time to populate the content. Make your project folder, `my-blog` to current working one and let's move on with the *Blog* content.

```bash
cd my-project
```

## Create Blog Content

### Initial cleaning up

Before we start with the newly created *Blog* content we need to clean up the one provided by the used project template.
Creating the project from the template speed up the creating process but the content put do demonstrate how nuxt works is not needed.

The files that needs to be deleted are:
```bash
content/hello.md
components/NuxtLogo.vue
components/Tutorial.vue
```

Replace the `static/favicon.ico` file with your *Blog* one.

Open the `pages/index.vue` file in your editor and change its content with:

```js
<template>
  <h1>Welcome to My Blog</h1>
</template>

<script>
export default {}
</script>
```

Now you are ready to start your *Blog* for the first time by running following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can save this revision as `initial commit` of your `my-blog`. Bare in mind that we are using the linting of git commits comments as well.
The format of git comments are based on [The Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
It's a good practice to format your git commit messages follow easy set of rules for creating an informative and explicit commit history.

### Create *Blog* markdown page

The [@nuxt/content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) module works by reading the files in `content/` directory. The `@nuxt/content` module can parse markdown, csv, yaml, json, json5 or xml files.

The `@nuxt/content` module gives access to injected variables that can be accessed and shown in page template. The default variables that are injected into document are:

* `body`: body text
* `dir`: directory
* `extension`: file extension (.md in this example)
* `path`: the file path
* `slug:` the file slug
* `toc`: an array containing our table of contents
* `createdAt`: the file creation date
* `updatedAt`: the date of the last file update

The custom injected variables can be added by putting a block of YAML front matter to markdown file. It must be at the top the file and must be a valid YAML format set between three triple dashed lines. For example:

```yaml
---
title: My first  Post
description: Learning how to create a blog
author: Known Well
img: first-post.jpg
alt: my first blog post
---
```


Create an `articles/` folder where the *Blog* articles will be stored.

```bash
mkdir content/articles
```

Now create the first article in a markdown file `content/articles/first-post.md`. Put some initial conntent in it.


```md
---
title: First  Post
description: Learning how to create a blog
author: Known Well
img: first-post.jpg
alt: my first blog post
---
# First Post

This is an example of content of the First post in **My Blog**.
```

To display content in our *Bog* page, we can use nuxt [dynamic pages](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/pages/#dynamic-pages) capability. Create a page named `_slug.vue` inside `pages/blog` folder. This will enable using the `params.slug` variable provided by vue router to get the name of each article.

Inside put the following content:

```js
<template>
  <article>
    <h1>{{ article.title }}</h1>
    <h2>by {{ article.author }}</h2>
    <p>{{ article.description }}</p>
    <img :src="article.img" :alt="article.alt" />
    <p>Article last updated: {{ article.updatedAt }}</p>

    <nuxt-content :document="article" />
  </article>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    async asyncData({ $content, params }) {
      const article = await $content('articles', params.slug).fetch()

      return { article }
    }
  }
</script>
```

The *index* page will list out our blog posts. Open `pages/index.vue` page and add following content:

```js
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Blog Posts</h1>
    <ul>
      <li v-for="article of articles" :key="article.slug">
        <NuxtLink :to="{ name: 'blog-slug', params: { slug: article.slug } }">
          <img :src="article.img" />
          <div>
            <h2>{{ article.title }}</h2>
            <p>by {{ article.author.name }}</p>
            <p>{{ article.description }}</p>
          </div>
        </NuxtLink>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    async asyncData({ $content, params }) {
      const articles = await $content('articles')
        .only(['title', 'description', 'img', 'slug', 'author'])
        .sortBy('createdAt', 'asc')
        .fetch()

      return {
        articles
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```

Run your *Blog* application and navigate from *index* page to blog article.


## Deploy

Since this is a Nuxt project it should follow the deployment recommendations from the official Nuxt documentation. There are multiple [deployment targets](https://nuxtjs.org/deployments) explain there but the one for the GitHub pages will be the one we will be using in this document.

To deploy via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), create or adjust the workflow which pushes the generated files from the `dist` folder to your default GitHub Pages branch `gh-pages`.

With an existing workflow, add the following step:

```markdown
- name: Deploy
  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    publish_dir: ./dist
```

For a new workflow, paste the following content into a new file called cd.yml in .github/workflows directory:

```markdown
name: cd

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  cd:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}

    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest]
        node: [14]

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@master

      - name: Setup node env
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2.1.2
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn

      - name: Generate
        run: yarn generate

      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist
```

Then commit this changes to your repository. Once complete, you'll see your gh-pages branch updated as well as your site.
